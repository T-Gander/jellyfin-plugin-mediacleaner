The idea behind this plugin is to have an easy way to run a task to find all movies and shows in your media collection that users haven't viewed in a number of cutoff days.

At the time of writing, the plugin is only capable of logging movies and shows that are stale (Unwatched for 90 days) by running a scheduled task. You will need to view your logs to know the number of stale files.

Planned features:
- Better logging to show more than just the count.
- A page that shows what media is currently flagged for removal. And a button to confirm removal.
- Integration with sonarr and radarr apis to delete your media.

Future features if I feel like it:
- Configurable media types.
